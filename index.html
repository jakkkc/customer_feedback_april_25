            their experience each month, categorized into five levels:
            Excellent, Very Good, Good, Average, and Poor.

          <p>
            <ul>
                <li> <strong>January:</strong> Most guests rated their stay as Excellent (about 60%), with Very Good and Good following at around 20% and 10%, respectively. Only a small number gave Average or Poor rating
                </li>
                <li> <strong>February:</strong> There was a big jump in Excellent ratings, rising to about 80%, while Very Good decreased to 10% and Good slightly dropped. Average and Poor remained very low.
                </li>
                <li><strong>March & April:</strong> The trend stayed strong with Excellent ratings around 70%, while Very Good climbed slightly. Good, Average, and Poor remained consistently low.

            </li><li><strong>Seasonal Patterns: </strong>If there are recurring spikes or dips, it suggests trends like high-demand periods or seasonal guest satisfaction changes.

          <p>
            The correlation heatmap reveals fascinating relationships between
            service aspects. Restaurant Service Quality (0.87) and Activity
            Coordination (0.83) show the strongest correlations with Staff
            Friendliness, suggesting guests perceive these services as
            interconnected experiences.

          <p>
            Interestingly, Wi-Fi satisfaction shows moderate correlation (0.65)
            with Overall Value perception, indicating that improved connectivity
            may positively influence guests' sense of getting good value. Bed
            Comfort and Bathroom Cleanliness, while scoring highest, show
            relatively low correlations with other services (0.2-0.4 range),
            suggesting they're evaluated more independently by guests.

            Bed Comfort and Bathroom Cleanliness have maintained perfect or
            near-perfect scores throughout the period. These physical aspects of
            the guest experience appear to be reliably excellent, with Bed
            Comfort achieving 100% Excellent ratings in January and February
            before receiving a single 'Very Good' rating in March and April.
            This consistency suggests our housekeeping and facilities
            maintenance protocols are exceptionally effective.

          <h3>Most Improved</h3>
          <p>
            Wi-Fi Connectivity has undergone a remarkable transformation. From
            being our lowest-rated service in January (6.7% Excellent) to
            achieving 33.3% Excellent by April, the improvement curve is one of
            the steepest we've observed. The timing aligns perfectly with our
            March infrastructure upgrades, showing immediate positive impact
            that continued to grow in the following month. Negative ratings
            disappeared completely by April, suggesting we've addressed the most
            severe connectivity issues.

          <h3>Attention Needed</h3>
          <p>
            Pricing satisfaction, while improving from 25% Excellent in January
            to 62.5% in April, remains our lowest-scoring category. The data
            shows guests are responding positively to our value-added packages
            introduced in February, but there's still a perception gap compared
            to other aspects of the experience. Interestingly, pricing
            satisfaction shows stronger correlation with intangible services
            (like staff interactions) than with physical amenities.

          <h3>Strong Correlations</h3>
          <p>
            The 0.87 correlation between Restaurant Service Quality and Staff
            Friendliness is among the strongest relationships in our data. This
            suggests guests don't silo their perceptions of service quality by
            department, but rather form holistic impressions that carry across
            different interactions. Similarly, the 0.83 correlation between
            Activity Coordination and Friendliness indicates that well-organized
            activities enhance perceptions of staff warmth and approachability.
